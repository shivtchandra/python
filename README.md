# Python Practice & Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and exercises designed to help understand and practice core Python programming concepts. Each script focuses on a different topic or problem, making this repo ideal for learners and those looking to refresh their Python skills.

## Features

- **Basic Python Concepts**  
  Demonstrates data types (integers, floats, booleans, strings), operators, and type conversions.

- **Conditional Statements and Loops**  
  Shows the use of `if-else` constructs, nested loops, and the `random` module for generating numbers and choices.

- **Working with Lists**  
  Includes list manipulations (access, update, append, insert, remove) and random selection from lists.

- **For Loops and Classic Exercises**  
  Iterates through lists, performs calculations, and implements common exercises like FizzBuzz and a random password generator.

- **Functions**  
  Features function definitions, arguments (both positional and keyword), return values, and example use cases (e.g., love score calculator, encryption).

- **Dictionaries**  
  Covers dictionary creation, access, updates, iteration, and nesting with lists and other dictionaries.

- **Mini Games & Projects**  
  - Blackjack game
  - Prime number checker
  - Number guessing game (with easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels)

## File Structure

- Each `dayX.py` file (e.g., `day1.py`, `day2.py`, ...) contains code snippets, exercises, or mini-projects for that day's topic.
- `Description` — Detailed notes about the concepts and exercises included in the repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivtchandra/python.git
   cd python
   ```
2. Run any of the Python files with:
   ```bash
   python day1.py
   ```
   (Replace `day1.py` with any file you'd like to explore.)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional packages are needed for most scripts, though some use the `random` module (part of Python’s standard library).
