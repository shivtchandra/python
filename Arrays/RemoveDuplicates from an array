// Brute force method to do this problem would be to use the set() function for removing the duplicates . 

def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        ar = set()
// set() will not take two values of the same number and will only take every number once.
        for i in nums:
            ar.add(i)
        arr = sorted(ar)
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            nums[i] = arr[i]
        return len(arr)

// We arrange nums into set and the sort it as values in set may not be stored in the same way as we feed them.
//Then we write a for loop for the set() and then assign those values to the nums array.
